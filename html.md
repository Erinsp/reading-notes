# Wireframing

### What is Wireframing?
- Wireframing allows the author to plan the information hierarchy of their website, app, or product.
- You can draw wireframes by hand (these are easier to make changes to) or use software to create them.
- Your workflow will depend on the complexity of the project. Less complex projects will have a more streamlined flow.

### Wireframing Steps
1. Research: Understand your audience 
2. Prepare research for quick reference: think about business and user goals, personas, use cases, competitor research
3. Map out the user flow
4. Sketch it out. Think about:
 - How to organize content
 - Which info is most important
 - What will the user see in certain areas
 - Which buttons or touch points are most important
5. Add some detail and start testing
6. Turn wireframes into prototypyes

### Aspects of a "good" wireframe
1. Clarity: It needs to be clear to the user what the use of the page is.
2. Confidence: It needs to be easy to use.
3. Simplicity: Don't add too much info or it will become confusing.
