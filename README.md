### _What does having a growth mindset mean?_
- A growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed minset.
- This means that you believe that even if you don't know how to do something right now, you can always learn it.

### Here are three reminders to help keep me in a growth mindset:
1. Don't compare yourself to others
2. Have patience with yourself if a concept doesn't come easily to you right away
3. Persevere! Keep trying and don't let yourself get frustrated
