# Markdown Notes

**What is markdown?**
- Markdown is an easy way to format text on a webpage. To use markdown, you just add symbols around your text to format it. 

For example, you can create **bold text**, *italicized text*, or even combine them to write **bold _and italicized text_ to really emphasize your point.**

You can also create structure in your page by using 

# Heading 1
## Heading 2 or
### Heading 3 

Some other useful things you can do with markdown are:
1. create an ordered list
2. [add a website link](http://hmpg.net/)
- create an unordered list
- You can even create a table!

Number | Reason
------ | --------
One | *You can make italic text*
Two | **you can make bold text**
Three | [you can add links](https://github.com/Erinsp)


**_It's pretty cool!_**
